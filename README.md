# clone_schema

**clone_schema** is a PostgreSQL utility that makes a copy of a given schema (DDL and/or DATA). It is based on the Community version of PostgreSQL. It works on most Linux distros and Windows versions.  It also runs on PostgreSQL in the cloud (AWS, GCP, MS Azure).

Handles following objects:

* Tables - structure (UDT columns, indexes, constraints, keys) and optionally, data
* Views, Materialized Views - Structure and data
* Sequences, Serial, Identity
* Functions/Procedures
* Types (composite and enum)
* Collations, Domains, Rules, Policies
* Triggers, Trigger Functions
* Comments
* ACLs (Permissions/Grants)

<br/>

Arguments:
* source schema
* target schema
* Enumerated list

<pre>source schema  Required: text - schema name</pre>
<pre>target schema  Required: text - table name</pre>
<pre>ENUM list      Required: One of 'DATA','NODATA','DDLONLY'</pre>
<pre>ENUM list      Optional: 'NOOWNER','NOACL','VERBOSE','FILECOPY'</pre>
By default, ownership and privileges are also cloned from source to target schema.  To override, specify **NOOWNER** and/or **NOACL** (similar to how pg_dump works). When **NOOWNER** is specified, the one running the script is the default owner unless overridden by a **SET ROLE** command before running this script. You may get faster results copying data to/from disk instead of in-memory copy. **FILECOPY** is a workaround for tables with complex UDT-type columns that fail to copy.  It only works for On-Prem PG Instances since it relies on using the COPY command to write to and read from disk.

Clone the schema with no data:
<br/>
>select clone_schema('sample', 'sample_clone', 'NODATA');
<br/>

Clone the schema with data:
<br/>
>select clone_schema('sample', 'sample_clone', 'DATA');<br/>
>select clone_schema('sample', 'sample_clone', 'DATA','VERBOSE');  -- show row copy progress
<br/>

Just generate DDL:
<br/>
>select clone_schema('sample', 'sample_clone', 'DDLONLY');

In this case, standard output with "INFO" lines are the generated DDL.
<br/><br/><br/>
The **schema_object_counts.sql** file is useful for validating the cloning results.  Just run it against source and target schemas to validate object counts after changing default schema name, **sample**.

# Regression Testing Overview
Regression Testing is done in the following order:
* Execute the **sampledb.sql** script to create the **clone_testing** database and the **sample** schema within it as the basis for the source schema.
* Clone the **sample** schema in the 3 ways possible (NODATA, DATA, DDLONLY).
* Run the **schema_object_counts.sql** queries to compare object counts and rows from the source and target schemas.
* Repeat all of the above for all supported versions of PG.

# Assumptions
* Testing and validation is done only through the Community version of PostgreSQL.
* The target schema uses the same tablespace(s) as the source schema.
* Dependent on an integrated function, pg_get_tabledef(), copied from another project, https://github.com/MichaelDBA/pg_get_tabledef.

# Limitations
* Only works for PG Versions 10 and up.
* You should not clone the "public" schema.  The resulting output may not be accurate even if it finishes without any errors.
* You should not use multiple, user-defined schema objects and expect cloning one schema to another to work.  This project does not support that at the present time.  It only supports 3 schemas basically: the source schema, the target schema, and objects defined in the public schema referenced by those user-defined schemas.
* Index names are not all the same in the cloned schema since some of the tables are created with the CREATE TABLE ... (LIKE ...) construct.  Those index names are automatically fabricated by PG with naming format that is prepended with table and column names separated by underscores and ending with "_idx".
* Foreign Tables are not handled at the present time.  They must be done manually.
* Case-sensitive (names with double quotes around them) schema names are not supported at the present time.
